🌀 Credit risk project 🌀
This is a project that used  machine learning (K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm). Based on the ENAHO database, a classification was made of the characteristics of people who had received credit and those who had not. Then, an algorithm was created to detect the risk of a person not being approved for credit based on certain characteristics.
